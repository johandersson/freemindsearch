## Overview of FreeMind Search
**FreeMind Search** is a dedicated desktop tool for **searching in multiple FreeMind and FreePlane mind maps**. It is designed for users of [Freeplane](https://www.freeplane.org/) and [FreeMind](http://freemind.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page). 

Both **FreePlane** and **FreeMind** offer powerful mind‑mapping features, but **neither supports searching across multiple maps**—they only search within the currently opened file. This application fills that gap by enabling fast, efficient multi‑map searching.

The program is an independent tool that searches in the XML file format of **FreePlane** and **FreeMind**, it is not a plugin to theese programs.

## Features  
- Search through any number of `.mm` files in a selected folder
- **Search inside notes in multiple mind maps!**
- Instantly locate nodes and notes containing your keywords  
- Clean, intuitive interface  
- Double‑click to open results directly in FreeMind or Freeplane  
- Full support for searching inside node notes  
- A huge time‑saver for users with large collections of maps
