## Overview  
**FreeMind Search ** is a dedicated desktop tool for **searching in multiple FreeMind and FreePlane mind maps**. It is designed for users of [Freeplane](https://www.freeplane.org/) and [FreeMind](http://freemind.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page). 

Both **FreePlane** and **FreeMind** offer powerful mind‑mapping features, but **neither supports searching across multiple maps**—they only search within the currently opened file. This application fills that gap by enabling fast, efficient multi‑map searching.

The program is an independent tool that searches in the xml-formatted **FreePlane** and **FreeMind** files, it is not a plugin to theese programs.

## Features  
- Search through any number of `.mm` files in a selected folder
- Search inside notes!
- Instantly locate nodes and notes containing your keywords  
- Clean, intuitive interface  
- Double‑click to open results directly in FreeMind or Freeplane  
- Full support for searching inside node notes  
- A huge time‑saver for users with large collections of maps
